        <h3>Analyzing 3M Patents</h3>
        <p>
          <i>3M Patents Innovation Strategy<br>
          Team Members: Christy C., Rajah C., Lorenzo M, Abdullah M., Ryan W.<br>
          Program(s): Python, R, Hadoop, Tableau, Gephi<br>
          Model(s): Topic Modeling, Graph analysis, clustering<br></i>
          <br>
          We analyzed 3M&#8217;s US patent portfolio relative to seven competitors using topic modeling, k-means clustering and network analysis. The dataset includes about
          33,000 patents for the eight companies. Relative to the selected competitors, 3M has a competitive advantage in areas like Stock Materials, Synthetic Resins,
          Optical Systems and Adhesives. Using cosine similarity on the class distribution by company, 3M&#8217;s patent portfolio is most like Bostik, Dow and Du Pont, who are
          predominately Synthetic Materials and Chemistry companies. General Electric and Siemens focus more on Energy and Data & Processing patents; however, these companies
          compete with 3M in areas like Surgery and Stock Materials patents.<br>
          <br>
          Next, we used Topic Modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation or LDA) to identify five topics in the patents&#8217; abstracts. We label the five topics as: Synthetic Materials,
          Chemistry, Energy, Electrical and Data & Processing. We then use <i>k</i>-means clustering on the topic probabilities to create five patent clusters, each corresponding to
          an LDA topic. Most of 3M&#8217;s patents (75%) are in Synthetic Materials and Chemistry patents.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, we examine shared Patent Title bigrams to analyze the relationship between patents using network analysis. Many of 3M&#8217;s patents share ideas and cross-pollinate
          to create new, distruptive innovations. Synthetic Materials and Chemistry patents exhibit the strongest cross-pollination as they share many bigrams in classes like
          Compositions, Adhesives, Abrasives and Synthetic Resins. On the other hand, 3M&#8217;s Electrical and Data & Processing patents are largely disconnected from the network.
          3M has a competitive disadvantage in these patents as GE, Honeywell and Siemens dominant the market. We also expanded our analysis to competitors in Synthetic Materials
          and Chemistry patents and 3M research collaboration with an assignee network.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>What Does All That Mean??</strong><br>
          <br>
          While 3M still enjoy a dominant position in Synthetic Materials, the external Dow/DuPont merger seriously threatens their market position, while internal initiatives
          from CEO Inge Thulin, attempting to increase patent quantity, have not yielded the desired results. Our research uncovered an objective way to measure the value of a
          patent: cross-pollination. (Similar to friends in a social network, we use Betweenness as a network measure of cross-pollination). GE seems to have mastered
          cross-pollination and enjoys an enviable position in the patent world; 3M has only a toe-hold in the world of cross-pollinators.<br>
          <br>
          We recommend cultivating our cross-pollination and beat competitors at their own game. Now that we know how to measure cross-pollination, 3M can both reward the best
          in-house inventors and snap up the best independent (freelance) inventors. Extending the cross-pollination measure to companies, we have a way to acquire small companies
          that cross-pollinate, extending our innovative reach. And for foreign or large companies, 3M should form strategic alliances, again using cross-pollination as a yardstick.
          Cross-pollination will create more patents, which in turn will bring more unique products to the market, creating value for customers. Diverting one-tenth of the R&D
          Budget to cross-pollination could help this strategy succeed without increasing expenditures. We wouldd spend the same dollars, but in a more focused, targeted fashion.
          A cross-pollination strategy should set Thulin&#8217;s innovation vision aright and ensure his long tenure at the helm. Never has 3M had such a powerful, data-driven tool
          with which to drive innovation in our patent program.<br>

        <h3>Donald Trump Voter Segmentation</h3>
        <p>
          <i>Team Members: Null<br>
          Program(s): R<br>
          Model(s): Clustering<br></i>
          <br>
          The purpose of this project was to look at the demographic profile of the people who vote for Donald Trump. This led me to create clusters
          of demographic profiles and see which cluster votes for Donald Trump more compared to the other clusters. The dataset contains primary results,
          demographic data, and a codebook. (Note: The data contains results from primary races as of March 2016, which is the reason why every state is
          not represented.) Creation of several other datasets during the project were performed to look at numbers more accurately. The first phase I
          focused solely on the primary_results.csv file. Created separate datasets to look at counties won, states won, and party ratios, all of which
          relied heavily on the fraction_votes variable. During the second phase I was concerned more with demographic data and needed to merge the two
          datasets together.<br>
          <br>
          For the modeling phase of the project I concentrated on clustering. The main idea behind <i>k</i>-means clustering is to minimize within-group variance
          while maximizing between-group variance. To begin, the <i>k</i>-means algorithm randomly assigns each observation into <i>k</i> groups and calculates the
          clusters center. The next two steps are done iteratively until convergence, [1] assign each observation to the group that has the closest center,
          and [2] after all observations have been reassigned, recalculate the group’s centers. Upon determining the value of <i>k</i>, we can finally run the
          <i>k</i>means algorithm in R. The kmeans function allows the user to specify centers, max iteration, and which particular algorithm to run, among others.
          We set centers, <i>k</i>, equal to 4 (identified via line chart), max iteration to 1000, and algorithm to MacQueen.<br>
          <br>
          While clustering is extremely useful, the output can be hard to interpret. Initially we have no clue as to what these clusters mean or what they
          represent. To help with this problem I looked at the mean of all the variables in each cluster and try to define what each cluster is. Below is a
          breakdown of the 4 clusters identified:<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Rural:</strong> 64% of the counties in the analysis fall into this cluster. This is the largest cluster and contains a high percentage of White and African
          American persons. The ethnicities with the lowest percentage are Hispanics and Asians, as well as the lowest foreign born percentage. Other
          characteristics of the cluster include the least educated, lowest median income, ~$37,000, and highest poverty level, 21.5%. This cluster has the
          highest percentage of Native Americans, 1.67%. Donald Trump has his highest winning percentage in this cluster, winning 74% of the counties in this
          cluster.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Rising Prosperity:</strong> 30% of the counties in the analysis fall into this cluster. This cluster maintains the highest percentage of white persons and
          low or lowest percentages of African Americans, Asians, and Hispanic persons. The homeowner rate is also the highest in this cluster than the others,
          while also having a high median household income and a low poverty rate. Donald Trump has his lowest winning percentage in this cluster, only winning
          53% of the counties in this cluster.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Urban:</strong> 5% of the counties fall into this cluster. They have a good mixed proportion of the White, African American, Asian, and Hispanic ethnicities,
          as well as foreign-born voters. This cluster is where you will find the highest educated and wealthiest citizens (median household income, ~$55,000)
          in the dataset. Donald Trump has won 72% of the counties in the cluster.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Metropolitan:</strong> 1% of the counties fall into this cluster. This cluster has the largest percentages of young voters and African Americans Asian, and
          Hispanic ethnicities; as well as the highest percentage of foreign-born persons. This cluster also has a high poverty rate, 17%, and the lowest
          homeowner rate, 61.5%. Unsurprisingly, boasting the highest population density too. Donald Trump has won nearly 70% of the counties in the cluster.<br>
          <br>
          Immediately, I notice some irregularities between my findings and the media. I was led to believe that Trump polls well with the older white
          population while not polling so well with other ethnicities. Yes, my findings tend to corroborate those reports that Trump polls well with the
          white population, winning 74% of the “Rural” cluster. However, he also has a high winning percentage in the “Metropolitan” cluster, which contains
          the highest percentage of young voters, African Americans, Asian, and Hispanics.

          <br>
          Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a virus spreading around the world. Per the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
          Diseases (NIAID) nearly 37 million people have HIV and 1.2 million people are living with HIV in the United States. However, a
          large portion are unaware of their HIV discovery. To decrease the transmission of the diseases and improve the women’s health,
          Microsoft announced the Women&#8217;s Health Risk Assessment competition that looks for machine learning solutions, in which Bill &
          Melinda Gates funded the competition. The focus of the competition is in the underdeveloped areas of the world, including most of
          Africa and India. In association with the World Health Organization (WHO) they developed a survey that reached 9,000 women in clinics
          and approximately 1,000 subjects in each region. The purpose of this study is to help clinics target the disease at risk and plan
          health care budget more efficiently so that more women can be treated in underdeveloped countries. The problem is a binary classification.
          As far as the expectation, researchers want to see what are the most important things that are associated with the infection of HIV
          among women ages 15-44.<br>
          <br>
          For us to build a relatively accurate model, we needed to find out which features that matter the most. To do it properly, we performed a
          random forest model on our dataset. The random forest model in Python scikit-learn package offers a way to see the importance of each
          independent variable relative to the dependent variable. The most important features revealed from this analysis are modcon, tribe, district,
          babydoc, labordeliv, geo, segment, debut, usecondom, and hivknow. Using these variables, among others, we decided to develop several different
          models including logistic regression, decision tree, random forests, and a neural network. The takeaways from this along with model creation
          and validation is that individuals with access to modern technologies (computers, radios, irrigation, etc.) and using modern contraception and/or
          condoms will lower the risk of HIV. Other factors that can radically influence the risk is the religion they follow, education, literacy, and
          income.<br>
          <br>
          We compared the models using mean square error (MSE) on validation data to select the best model for the project. Considering we use
          variable clustering for the predictor selection prior to logistic regression, decision tree and neural network, we used SAS e-Miner
          to compare these three models, and the program selects the neural network to be the best model with the MSE of 0.12. However, compared
          with the MSE generated using cross-validation from ridge regression and random forest, we believe that random forest is the best model
          to predict HIV subgroup in this project with the lowest MSE of 0.07.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, our group wanted to look at some sort of unsupervised learning to experiment with. The dataset lends itself well to be segmented
          especially considering that it contains a myriad of health, demographic, and socio-economic features. The clustering analysis was done
          through R, and we used the <i>k</i>-means approach. After consulting the within sum of squares “elbow” plot, <i>k</i> was determined to be set at 3.
          Looking at the means of each cluster it becomes clear that there are differences among them.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Cluster 1: Educated Young Women</strong> - This cluster has the youngest average age of all the other clusters, 18. Contains the
          lowest percentage of respondents that responded yes to EVER_HAD_SEX and EVER_BEEN_PREGNANT, which leads to the smallest ratio of the
          clusters that currently have a child. Women in this cluster are educated as well, 31% of them are currently in school, they are literate and
          are the most educated of the three clusters. Lowest risk of HIV infection and mostly christian or muslim.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Cluster 2: Sexually Active Mid 20s Women</strong> - As the name says, this cluster’s average age is 26 and they contain the highest
          percentage of women that have had sex, been pregnant, and had multiple partners. Lowest percentage (6%) in school, which could be explained
          since they are older and may be out of school now. They are still literate and moderately educated. Highest HIVknow status, and most likely
          to be married and/or have children. Highest risk of HIV infection and mostly christian or muslim.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Cluster 3: Other</strong> - This cluster is all over the place, there is no proper way to describe them. A couple things to note
          is that they are mostly muslim and hindu; and they are the least educated. However, they are more likely to own a cooker or fridge compared
          to the other clusters.
